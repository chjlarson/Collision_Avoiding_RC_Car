# Collision_Avoiding_RC_Car

## DETAILS: ##
This was my senior capstone I did while I was getting my BSCS.

> This project had two main parts. The initial part of the project was
> to program a remote-controlled car to be controlled by a variety of
> controllers. The second part of the project was to program the
> remote-controlled car with a basic collision-avoidance algorithm. This
> algorithm utilized the surrounding environmental information to
> determine a suitable course of action without the need for human
> input. Both of these goals were achieved by utilizing an Arduino Uno
> and a Raspberry Pi to communicate with both each other and the
> hardware components of the remote-controlled car.
